<p class="dropcap">Ypres has a past quite different from that of Nieuport
or Dixmude, a past of war and magnificence.
Her main square, next to that of Brussels, is the
most beautiful in the world. Her Town Hall, her
Cathedral, her Market Hall, combine all the splendors.
The Town Hall and Cathedral are assuredly beautiful,
but the Market Hall is more than that, for it is unique. Its
severity, its length, the symmetry of its lines, its roofs like
great wings feathered with slates, its soaring and massive
walls, suggest a giant triumphal arch. It is so large that in
time of peril the whole town could gather there for shelter.</p>

<p>The Market Hall of Ypres has always been a communal
building. In the Middle Ages it was the business center of
the cloth makers, the weavers. It has seen popular revolts
and rioting. It has known agony and passion, joy and pride.
For centuries it has stood there, the wonder of Ypres.</p>

<p class="smaller">Born at St. Amand, Belgium, on the River Scheldt, May, 1855; died
at Rouen, France, November, 1916. Verhaeren, a patriot of exalted
inspiration, was one of the finest poets of his generation. He “made
poetry realize the modern world.” “At his highest, he is the voice of the
city, the train, the factory, the dynamo; the spirit of the crowd, the
multitude, the dream within them and beyond them.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">For the story of the primitive inhabitants of Belgium,
we must consult the chronicles of the Belgae,
a Gallic race extolled for their bravery by Julius
Caesar, half a century before the birth of Christ.
Long before the Romans came, the fair land bounded by the
Atlantic, the Rhine, the Alps, the Mediterranean and the
Pyrenees was occupied by the Gauls, who
were called in their own language, “Celts.”
Gaul, divided into three parts, was inhabited
in the north by the Belgae; in the
middle region by the Celts, or Gauls proper;
and in the south by the Aquitani. This
ancient race remained under the Roman
yoke for more than five centuries. Meantime,
a Frankish tribe came from across
the Rhine to occupy what we know as the
Flemish Plain. The western part of what
was called Belgium in that day (and included
the land known to us as Holland)
was ceded to France; eastern provinces
fell to Germany, and for three hundred
years comprised the duchy of Lower Alsace.
The Province of Liège, on the eastern
border, existed for nearly a thousand
years as a possession of the bishop-princes
of the Holy Roman (or German-Roman)
Empire, which began with Charlemagne
in the year 800.</p>

<p>The hereditary principalities of Flanders,
Hainaut, Artois, Namur, Brabant,
Limburg, Antwerp and Malines were established
in the Middle Ages. The geographical
divisions of these feudal states,
with the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, were
subjected to little change throughout succeeding
centuries, and form the framework
of the present-day kingdom of Belgium.
When we read the romantic story
of the Belgian countships, duchies and
baronies, we discover how large a part
their knights played in the chivalrous
enterprises of Europe. The “Low Countries,”
of which Belgium was the most important,
were represented in the Crusades
by such zealous warriors as Godfrey of
Bouillon, Marquis of Antwerp, and that
Count of Flanders who became the first
King of Jerusalem. Another Count of
Flanders, Baldwin IX, was crowned Emperor
of the East when the Crusaders
entered Constantinople in 1204.</p>

<p>The rise of Belgian cities dates from the
founding of the cloth markets in the tenth
century. From the thirteenth to the sixteenth
centuries, hundreds of trading vessels
entered Flemish ports, carrying away
carpets, tapestries, cannon, lace, silks,
linens, embroideries and metal-ware.
Charles the Fifth, who was very vain of his
Belgian possessions, boasted to Francis the
First, of France, that he “could put Paris
inside his Ghent.” The French word for
glove is <i>gant</i>: the pun is obvious. In the
sixteenth century Ghent surpassed London
in population and trade. Belgian cities
were supreme in Europe. Belgian provinces
were at the zenith of their prosperity.</p>

<p>Chroniclers of Belgian history divide
the period between 1555 and 1830 into
six sections: the devastating reign of
Philip Second of Spain; the more beneficent
and independent reign of Philip’s
daughter and her husband, Archduke Albert;
the renewal of direct Spanish rule;
Austrian rule; French rule; and Dutch
rule. For more than a century most of
Europe’s battles were fought on Belgian
soil. “The Netherlands,” a writer declared
in 1642, “have been for many years
the very cock-pit of Christendom, the
school of arms and rendezvous of adventurous
spirits.”</p>

<p>The battledore of war drove Belgium,
the shuttlecock, to Spain, then to Austria,
to France, and back to Austria again. At
the end of the French Revolution all the
provinces, including Liège, became part of
France. Under the Republic and during
the reign of Napoleon I., Belgium enjoyed
a period of comparative peace. In 1814,
against the will of the people, their land
was ceded to the Dutch by the Congress
of Vienna. By the Revolution of 1830,
Belgium became an independent nation.
Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg was
elected the first King. The perpetual
neutrality of Belgium was insured by the
leading powers of Europe, though the
people would have resisted this agreement
if the will of England and Prussia had not
prevailed to make the war-torn territory
a bulwark against France.</p>

<p>Leopold I. was succeeded in 1865 by
Leopold II., who advanced the industrial
status of the country, and brought about
the annexation of the Congo Free State, in
Africa. Albert, son of this monarch’s
brother, came to the throne in 1909.</p>

<p>Though its foundations as an independent
nation were several times threatened,
the neutrality of the kingdom was preserved
until the momentous year 1914,
when the treaty executed eighty-three
years before was contemptuously regarded
by the Germans as but “a scrap of paper.”
Once more, Belgium became the “cock-pit
of Europe,” and for four years suffered
the ravages of the most ruthless war in
history. The King and Queen, driven
out of Brussels by the invasion of the Teutonic
hordes, took refuge in La Panne, a
village just north of the French boundary.
By the treaty of Versailles the Belgian
frontiers were again restored. The inhabitants
of a country proverbially industrious
are now making commercial and agricultural
history, undoing as far as possible
the work of the Hun.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The charters of medieval provinces formed the basis
of the Belgian Constitution, which, with the exception
of the Dutch, is the most ancient written constitution
still in force on the Continent. The makers
of this most excellently devised code of fundamental laws
decreed that as an independent state Belgium should be a
constitutional, representative and hereditary
Government, and that a King should
rule, supported by a Senate and a Chamber
of Representatives elected by the
people. The ministries of War; Interior;
Finance; Foreign Affairs, Science and Art;
Justice; Agriculture and Public Works;
Railways; Marine, Posts and Telegraphs;
Industry and Labor; Colonies are appointed
to act for the King in relation to
his subjects. Though a majority of the
seven and a half millions of people adhere
to the Roman Catholic Church, there is no
State religion. The chief political parties
are the Catholic, the Liberal, the Socialist,
and the Catholic-Democrat.</p>

<p>Originally, only those men of the monarchy
that owned a certain amount of
property had the vote. Since 1894, every
male citizen twenty-five years of age has
been permitted to vote if he has lived at
least a year in the same commune. As a
result, the number of the enfranchised has
increased ten-fold. By the “plural-voting
system,” extra votes are allowed to heads
of families, to tax-payers who receive a
stipulated sum from Belgian sources, and
to certain men of learning. The limit of
votes that can be cast by one man is
three. The clergy, professional men and
peasant landowners have a voting advantage
over the laboring class, many of
whose members belong to the Socialist
Party.</p>

<p>The political affiliations of the Belgian
people very intimately affect their daily
lives. As an English writer observes,
“Politics enter into almost every phase of
social activity and philanthropic effort.
Thus in one town there will be a Catholic,
a Liberal, and a Socialist trade union, a
Catholic, a Liberal, and a Socialist co-operative
bakery, a Catholic, a Liberal,
and a Socialist thrift society, each catering
for similar people, but each confining
its attention to members of its own
political party. The separation extends
to cafés, gymnasiums, choral, temperance
and literary societies; indeed it cuts right
through life. It often happens that one
of the parties in a particular town is not
strong enough to maintain an organization.
In such cases its members must
dispense with its benefits or leave their
party in order to enjoy them elsewhere.”
In a village near Bruges the writer knew
an adherent of the Liberal Party who for
days suffered grave need of a physician because
the only one of his own political leanings
was absent from town on a vacation.
A Socialist blacksmith has only Socialist
horses to shoe; the flour of a Catholic miller
is baked only in ovens owned by a Catholic.</p>

<p>When the French ruled Belgium, before
the Fall of the Empire, early in the nineteenth
century, they introduced the Napoleonic
Code&mdash;a system of laws partially
observed in the kingdom today. The
<i>Codes Belges</i> also comprise sundry ancient
laws of the original nine provinces.</p>

<p>The Court of Cassation, the highest
court in the land, has but one judge. It
is his duty to examine every judgment
passed by lower courts, and to determine
whether or not it shall be annulled. The
Courts of Appeal are three, and their
judges are appointed by the King for life.
Civil suits are commenced in the Courts
of First Instance, which are supplemented
by Tribunals of Commerce, held in Antwerp,
Ghent, and other cities, to decide
disputes that arise between persons having
business relations. The equivalent of
the Anglo-Saxon Criminal and Police
Courts are the courts of Assizes and Justice
of the Peace. Trial by a jury of twelve
men is required by law. Capital punishment
is provided for those found guilty
of murder, but, though sentenced formally
to death, the prisoner is actually consigned
to live out his span of years in
solitary confinement in the great prison
at Louvain.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Belgium is divided into
nine provinces&mdash;Antwerp, Brabant, West
Flanders, East Flanders, Hainaut, Liège,
Limburg, Namur, and Luxemburg (not to
be confused with the adjoining political
state of the same name). Each province
is subdivided into cantons and communes,
presided over by a governor nominated by
the King.</p>

<p>The children of Belgian subjects are
educated at the expense of the State, unless
their parents are able to pay a modest
fee. The Minister of Instruction regularly
receives reports from inspectors who
make a tour of all the schools in each
province, and, in the grammar schools, the
Government has the right to name the
teaching staff. State universities are
maintained at Ghent and Liège; at Brussels
and Louvain there are institutions
that afford free instruction in advanced
subjects and in law and medicine. There
are also many schools that are maintained
by the clergy of the Roman Catholic
Church. As a result of compulsory education
laws, about ninety per cent. of the
population are able to read and write.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Among the hills of eastern Belgium there lives a
race of men&mdash;vivacious and hardy, immensely
proud of their ancient origin, who are descended
from one of the Gallic tribes conquered by the
Romans twenty centuries ago. These interesting people&mdash;they
are called Walloons&mdash;inherited from their conquerors a
Romanic dialect which they made their
own. Though more like French than any
other language, it can scarcely be understood
by natives of France. However, in
modern times, French has supplanted the
dialect of Wallonia, except in intimate intercourse,
and is the chosen tongue of the
professional classes throughout most of
Belgium.</p>

<p>West of the Maas (Meuse) River Valley
stretch the plains of the Flemings&mdash;stout,
hardworking sons of Teutons and Franks
who in the Romans’ time overran the basin
of the Scheldt and its treeless barrens.
These, for the most part, know only Flemish,
the language of Flanders&mdash;a richly
expressive, unlovely-sounding tongue,
closely related to Dutch and German.</p>

<p>Walloons and Flemish were often on
opposite sides of the battlefield, until the
provinces were united five centuries ago
under Philip the Good of Burgundy.
Since then, they have been divided by no
issue of vital importance except that of
language. For many years French was the
language of the Belgian Government and
press, of universities and men of learning.
Walloons employed only French, while few
of the north Belgium peasants would use
any language but that of Flanders.</p>

<p>This lingual barrier between a people
having the same national ideals is an ever-present
cause of contention and misunderstanding.
Suppose half the inhabitants of
Ohio refused to learn the language of the
other half, and each section was constantly
on the alert to exalt its own tongue. Picture
the possibilities of conflict and jealousy
among a people otherwise closely
allied, with the same government, and with
daily interchange of interests.</p>

<p>Less than one-seventh of the Belgian
population are able to speak both French
and Flemish. The remaining six-sevenths are
about equally divided between those
that know only their own tongue&mdash;and object
on principle to learning the tongue
the other half speak.</p>

<p>One hears much in Belgium of the
“Flemish Movement,” whose motto,
adopted not long after the establishment
of national independence, in 1830, is the
Flemish sentence, “<i>De taal is gansch het
volk</i>” (“The language is the whole people”).
This organized effort to foster Flemish
traditions and literature had from the
first the support of public men and writers,
including Henri Conscience, Ledeganck,
and Van Beers, who lent their voices and
their pens to extol the heroic deeds of
Flanders and to advance in every way
possible the influence of the language in
the kingdom. Maeterlinck and Verhaeren
have employed both Flemish and French
in writing prose and poetry. The Walloons,
anxious that the French tongue
should continue to predominate in official
affairs, steadfastly opposed the agitators
of the <i>Mouvement Flamingant</i>. But at last
the Flemings won their fight. Before the
law, both languages are now equal; public
documents and notices are printed in
“the two national languages”; advocates
may plead their cases in either one, according
to preference, and in many towns
street signs appear in both Flemish and
French. Attempts to compel all employees
of the Government to learn both languages
has been only partially successful.</p>

<p>The Flemings are not only rather more
numerous than the Walloons, but they are
bound by their common loyalty to the
Church of their fathers. The Walloons
are of the Liberal faith, politically, and not
such zealous churchmen as their Flemish
brothers. Since the year 1884, the Flemish
Party, also called the Conservative or
Catholic Party, has been in power. A Flemish
Academy and theaters for the presentation
of the drama in Flemish were erected,
in cities like Antwerp and Ghent, and these
still receive part of their support from the
State.</p>

<p>The popular balladists of the Walloons
are the poets, Defrecheux (de-frech-eu)
and Vrindts. Camille Lemonnier (le-mon-nee-ay),
whose medium is French, has
written powerful novels of both Walloon
and Flemish life. “It is to Germany’s
interest,” says an observer, “that the
Flemish movement should develop and
become more markedly aggressive. On
the other hand, France cannot but view
with rising apprehension the decline of
her influence in Belgium, which will sink
to a still lower point if the propagators of
the revived and intensified Flemish
movement attain all their ends.”</p>

<p>It is gratifying to record that the World
War unified more than any other agency
has ever done the people of the north and
south of Belgium.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Belgian customs, habits and amusements are
strongly rooted in the soil. Half the population of
the country maintains life by tilling the land. The
nation’s prosperity, greatly affected by the discovery
and operation of prolific mines, is nevertheless due in large
part to the activity of peasant proprietors&mdash;owners of a few
acres that are usually cultivated with the
help of all the family. Grains, grape
vines, sugar beets and vegetables, dairy
cows and huge Belgian horses are the chief
products of the fields. The amount of
productive land in the kingdom is about
four-fifths of the entire area.</p>

<p>No one that has ever looked over the
hedge of a Belgian pasture will ever forget
the sight of black and white cows as
large as prize bulls in other countries, and
of awkwardly cavorting colts, taller and
much heavier about the joints than ordinary
American farm horses. On the cobbled
roads of Belgium one meets these
splendid horses, moving ponderously, embraced
by the shafts of capacious two-wheeled
carts. Equally picturesque are
the dogs of burden, hitched single, or in
teams of two or three, drawing wagon-loads
of milk, bread or fuel. Not infrequently,
one or more members of the
owner’s family are included in the load the
dogs must pull. I once counted a jovial
group of seven persons seated on meal-bags
in a cart drawn by a panting pair of
mastiffs. At country cross-roads the sign
is frequently displayed: “Treat the animals
with kindness”; but violations of the
laws of humanity are so common as to
excite little comment among the blunt-mannered
country-folk of Belgium.</p>

<p>Before low-roofed houses bordering
Flemish roads, the pilgrim discovers rows
of lace-makers, comprising the feminine
occupants of buff-colored cottages. Often
there are children six or seven years of age
perched on the straight-backed chairs.
Their tousled heads barely reach above the
broad “pillow” on which they and their
sisters ceaselessly weave the spindles from
dawn to twilight. The pay of a lace-worker
averages a franc a day, or twenty
cents for eight to ten hours of skilled labor.
The lace made in these peasant homes is
contracted for by buyers from Brussels or
Bruges, who supply the thread. An expert
worker, who has perhaps been trained in a
convent school and is familiar with the
delicate patterns of Princess, Cluny, Mechlin,
Valenciennes, and Brussels lace, rarely
receives more than fifty cents a day.</p>

<p>Before daybreak, the roads of the Belgian
countryside resound with the rumble
of wheels and the clack of wooden shoes.
All through the sunlit hours until nightfall
the stooping figures of men and women
are seen in the fields. In Walloon districts
the farmers live in settlements that adjoin
the tilled acres. Flemish landowners are
wont to build their homes apart from each
other, with perhaps the chateau of a rich
merchant as the pivotal center of the scattered
dwellings. Within the stone or
stucco-covered brick cottages of farmer
and villager, and in the rear yard bounded
by bake-house, wash-house and animal
shed, the household duties are performed
by the mother of the family, or by a
daughter that can be spared from field-work.
An intensively cultivated half-acre
plot may yield an income of a hundred and
fifty dollars a year, and on this meager
sum a family that raises its own produce
often manages to exist.</p>

<p>If the weekdays of the Belgian peasant
are given over to unrelieved toil, on Sunday,
Flemish and Walloon communities
burst into gaiety, and the sound of the
automatic piano is in the land. Women
in voluminous skirts and tight basques,
men in proper black suits and boots, wend
their way after mass to the nearest tavern,
and there whirl the hours away until closing
time. Behind the bar presides the
robust and well-coiffed wife of the proprietor,
while her daughters help in the serving
of light beverages and bread and butter
sandwiches. The kirmess, which at
some time during the summer occupies the
principal square of every town in Belgium,
is especially dear to the hearts of the natives.
Fakirs, magicians, circus performers, freaks,
caged animals, merry-go-rounds and their
wheezy calliopes are the lure for heavy-footed
squires, matrons that resemble the
rollicking models of the painters, Jordaens
and the younger Teniers, and delighted
apple-cheeked children. On holidays of
national importance, pilgrimages to favorite
shrines are organized, or the populace
surrenders itself to the enjoyment of archery
contests, games of ball, pigeon-flying,
dog races, smoking competitions, and processions,
many of them allegorical in character
and of genuine historic interest.
Preceding the War, not a July in twelve
centuries but had seen in “quaint, dull
Furnes,” in West Flanders, the impressive
“<i>Procession de Pénitence</i>,” in which a great
number of characters in medieval costumes
represented scenes from the Old Testament
and the Story of the Passion. Conceive
the wire-pulling among ambitious
mothers to insure a place as Mary or
Joseph for their Mitsche or Jan! Imagine
the exaltation of a wife whose fame rests
at other times of the year upon the excellence
of her raisin bread, or the spotlessness
of her floors, to be chosen to walk in hooded
black cloak near the symbol of the Sacrament!
Material as the Belgians are in
thought, and often dour, even loutish in
conduct, they are devoted to form and the
tinseled show, to music and the dance, and
to emotional celebrations of every sort.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It is befitting that a city more than fourteen hundred
years of age should present many dignified
aspects&mdash;that its buildings should be wreathed in
the mists of antiquity, and that its traditions should
be hallowed. Brussels&mdash;“a manor near the marsh”&mdash;is
shrined in a niche of the ages, its pre-medieval garments clothe
it richly. Yet the manners of the Belgian
capital are modern, and the life there,
while based on Flemish custom, is compared,
with reservations, to the life of
Paris. The presence of the Court at the
Royal Palace near the center of the city,
and at Laeken, the favorite residence of
the King and Queen, distant a few miles
in the country, has its effect upon the conduct
of Brussels society. However, the
city is largely given over to middle-class
habits and its chief pleasures are centered
in the home.</p>

<p>It is the custom for nearly everyone in
the city to rise soon after daybreak.
Housekeepers, even those highly placed
in the Brussels world, go early to market.
Beneath the florid gables of the <i>Grand’
Place</i>, white-capped farm-women sit behind
their stalls of dewy vegetables and
cheese and butter and home-grown posies,
while the noise of barking dray-dogs, stabled
in a neighboring street, obtrudes upon
the bargaining. The men are in their
places of business by half-past eight. At
noon all Brussels dines, heavily and well;
food prices, in peace times, are never excessive.
After supper those that seek
diversion outside their homes visit the
Flemish and French theaters, or the Opera,
or they go to a café where, over a convivial
cup or glass, they listen to a well-chosen
program of orchestral and organ
music. Sometimes a member of the Opera
company appears, or an instrumentalist in
popular favor. The checker-board is in
evidence; some of the patrons write letters,
others read native and foreign journals,
supplied by the management.… By
half-past ten the room begins to empty.
The good burghers of Brussels, their wives
and their children take their way homeward,
and to bed.</p>

<p>Religious fetes and historical pageants
are enjoyed with true Flemish zest. One
of the things the plain people of Brussels
like best to do is to dress in the costume
of various periods the quaint “manneken”
that surmounts a fountain behind the
City Hall. This little bronze figure has
been alternately decked with the colors of
conquerors and revolutionists since it was
erected just three hundred years ago. In
the year of Our Lord 1918 it put off forever,
let us hope, the insignia of the Teutons
for the Belgian red, yellow and black.</p>

<p>In all but the city’s largest shops, women
are in sole charge. Their husbands and
fathers are usually occupied in positions
deemed more worthy of masculine endeavor.
The children are in school; a
daughter of talent is studying at the famous
Royal Conservatory; the son may
be away learning to be a sailor or a doctor
or a soldier. Nearly everybody works at
one thing or another. People of leisure
ride and motor in the fashionable Avenue
Louise in the afternoon, and take refreshment
at the “Dairy,” amid the green delights
of the principal city park&mdash;the
“Wood of Cambre.” In the restaurants
the wife of the proprietor is behind the
cashier’s desk, and in brisk and friendly
fashion plays the part of hostess to the
patrons of the establishment.</p>

<p>The most vital interest in the estimate
of Belgians of all classes is their home life.
Certainly there are no people more industrious
in the preservation of family traditions.
Strangers are often surprised to
learn that the old-time phrase, “East,
West, Home’s Best,” originated, not with
the Anglo-Saxons, but with the Flemish.</p>

<p>In Antwerp, quays are brisk with sailors,
many of them in picturesquely uncouth
costumes. At the Flemish Theater, subsidized
by the Government, and at the Opera,
the city’s rich betray the fondness of their
race for jewels and brocaded dress stuffs.
Sometimes, as one gazes at a gorgeously
appareled lady of Antwerp, one of Van
Dyck’s paintings seems to have come
to life. The most favored resort is the
Zoological Garden where music and a
sprightly restaurant attract the pleasure-loving
Antwerpers, and tourists who wish
to see the vivid city at its gayest. At the
late sunset hour in the summertime, the
people of Antwerp are also fond of going to
the Kursaal on the bank of “the massive
and lethargic Scheldt,” there to enjoy sky
pictures of uncommon magnificence.</p>

<p>Nearly all the populous communities of
Belgium give enthusiastic attention to
the development of water sports, football,
hockey and horse-racing. The young
Flemings of progressive Ghent, to the
consternation of the English, have more
than once carried off honors for rowing at
the Henley Regatta, the classic event of
the Thames.</p>

<p>Liège, mistress of industrial and intellectual
Wallonia, has her vivacious side,
too. Her children are devoted to music
and pageantry, and delight in out-of-door
festivals. Well-to-do residents build their
mansions in the hills of the suburbs, and
thus combine city and rural pleasures.
Often they travel to Brussels and Ostend,
where the ladies of Liège are much admired
for their brunette attractions, and the men
for their Gallic wit and gallant manners.</p>

<p class="dropcap">A great and beneficent man was Philip the Good,
one of the magnificent Dukes of Burgundy who ruled
over the Netherlands in the fifteenth century. In
Bruges, their capital, craftsmen were encouraged in
the making of brocades and fine glass, ornaments of precious
metal, miniatures and illuminated manuscripts. Professor
John C. Van Dyke remarks that, with the
rise of the House of Burgundy, “The
Flemish people became strong enough to
defy both Germany and France, and
wealthy enough, through their commerce
with Spain, Italy and France to encourage
art not only at the ducal court, but in the
churches and among the citizens of the
various towns.” The story of Flemish
painting will be related and illustrated in
a future number of The Mentor.</p>

<p>The brothers Van Eyck, Hubert (born
1370) and Jan (1390), were not the first
of the Fleming painters to substitute oil
for other mediums in mixing paints, but
the use of oil paints became more popular
after their invention of certain mellow
colors associated with their names. Their
most renowned work is the twelve-paneled
altar-piece painted for St. Bavon’s Church,
Ghent, the city of their birth. This is the
most important work of the early Flemish
school, in composition, drawing and lustrous
detail. Hans Memling, the next
great painter of the Flemish School, if we
except that excellent draftsman and decorative
artist, Roger van der Weyden, was
especially successful in making portraits
and religious pictures. His infinitely beautiful
“Reliquary of St. Ursula,” executed
about the middle of the fifteenth century
for the Hospital of St. John, Bruges, represents
the apex of his ability as a miniaturist.</p>

<p>Another of the early Flemish painters
was Quentin Metsys (1466-1530)&mdash;a blacksmith
by trade, who became a painter
because the stern father of the maiden he
adored refused to give her hand to any
but an artist. To the surprise of the art-loving
old city of Antwerp, Metsys
achieved such mastery with the brush
that, after several years of persevering
effort, he was hailed as the best Flemish
painter of his century.</p>

<p>The prince of the “Golden Age of Art” in
Flanders was Petrus Paulus Rubens, who
was born in the year 1577. While a student
in Italy, a reigning Italian duke sent him
on a mission to the King of Spain. The
passport he was instructed to present to
Philip III. introduced him as “Peter Paul,
a Fleming, who will say all that is proper,
like the well-informed man that he is.
Peter Paul is very successful in painting
portraits. If any ladies of quality wish
their pictures, let them take advantage of
his presence.” Wherever the young artist
traveled&mdash;to Italy, to Spain, to France, to
England, he was received with honors.
Rubens was twice married, and his two
wives and their children were often his
models. He loved to paint sumptuous
flesh and rosy faces, richly dressed children,
cavaliers, gods and goddesses; and
he delighted to make designs for the tapestries
of Brussels and Arras. One of the pictures
by which he is best remembered is
the divine group, “The Descent from the
Cross,” which has lately been restored
to its place in the Antwerp Cathedral,
after a period of over four years’ seclusion,
safe from the enemy’s hands. So sure
was the painter’s skill and so great his
vogue that he became very rich and lived
in a splendid house filled with rare
objects of art. Many of his largest canvases
were painted by pupils under his
supervision. In all, he painted, or supervised,
nearly two thousand pictures, some
of them of huge dimensions. When he
died in 1640 he was buried with great
pomp in Antwerp, which proudly calls
itself, “Rubens’s City.”</p>

<p>Still another son of the city of Antwerp,
Sir Anthony Van Dyck, was a pupil of
the great Rubens, and very early became
a master. Visitors to the notable galleries
of the world invariably find there at least
one example of Van Dyck’s artistry.
He painted with special enthusiasm the
faces and figures of kings and courtiers,
the richly bedecked wives of wealthy
burghers, and, also, spirited horses and
dogs of high degree. Besides, he gained
renown for his sensitively conceived religious
pictures. Charles I. of England made
Van Dyck his court painter, and the king
and his nobles were often pleased to sit for
him. But prosperity led to extravagance,
and extravagance to impoverishment and
a broken spirit. Van Dyck died when still
a comparatively young man. He is declared
by many critics to have been the
most distinguished portraitist of the Flemish
School&mdash;some say of any school and
any century.</p>

<p>Most amusing and characteristic are
the pieces descriptive of Flemish life left
to us by Jacob Jordaens and by David
Teniers the Younger, who painted hundreds
of pictures and rivaled the Dutchman,
Jan Steen, as a delineator of fairs and
homely festivities.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Before the windows of my cottage, facing the level beach
of La Panne, there came very often in the summer of 1913
a monarch, tall and blond, and nearly always he was the
center of a joyous group of youths and children. Three of
the group were his sons and his daughter; six slim youngsters
called the Emperor of Austria grandfather. During the long
summer afternoons the friends laboriously erected and recklessly demolished
sand forts and barricades amid the tufted dunes, while laughter and
the clamor of mimic assault disturbed the peace of the strand. Sometimes
I wished that the children of the King of Belgium and their cousins,
the grandchildren of the Austrian emperor, would find another place to
play their war games! I could not know that before the year was out
three of these care-free companions would be playing the game in earnest&mdash;one
of them in the ranks of the invaders.… That fishing sloops of
La Panne, lying aslant on the beach or spreading their deep-hued sails to
the North Sea wind, would within a twelve-month be consumed by
monsters of the deep. That
soon the wide smooth shore
would be a tenting-ground for
Belgian soldiers swept back
from Antwerp. That neighbor
villages would be fenced
with arms. That only a few
square miles of his country
would be left to the dauntless
King of the Belgians.</p>

<h3><i>On Belgian Roads</i></h3>

<p>Traveling the roads of
Belgium on foot or by steam
tram, by slothful barge, or by
the very efficient railways of the Belgian Government, we come upon
many a picture of odd-fashioned roofs and mirroring water-streets, of city
squares and gilded cornices, of farm cots scattered like sheep across the
downs, of corpulent windmills busy at their grinding, of canal-boats
moving among the flat Flemish fields, of soil-stained men and women
tending crops of sugar-beets, flax and grains.</p>

<p>South of Flanders and Brabant, wide sea-freshened vistas give way
to murky landscapes and cities that bristle with the spires of industry.
Here, settlements of coal miners, steel workers, glass makers, cotton spinners,
fill the foreground of the scene. Most of the factory people belong
to the robust and spirited race of the Walloons, who live near the eastern
and southern frontiers. Their Celtic ancestors occupied the valley of the
Meuse (meuz) long before the
Christian era. Among themselves
they speak a dialect bequeathed
by the Romans. Officially their
language is French, just as the
Flemish tongue, of “Low Country”
origin, is the recognized
language of the Belgians of the
north.</p>

extensively grown to supply the demand for linen. Here
we see it in the process of “retting” in the river, to rot off the
woody bark and stems</p>

<p>The Walloons are like the
French in many ways. They
have quick wits and a ready command
of forceful phrases, they
are clever workmen, and they
have an immense enthusiasm
for one of their kind that displays
a gift for art or music.
We came one evening to a small
manufacturing town near Liège
(lee-ayzh), metropolis of the Walloon country, and found the main street
dressed with flags and lanterns. The town hall was illuminated, a procession
was forming, and there were crowds waiting at the railway station.
“Yes,” said the hotel proprietor, “it is a fete day&mdash;for the people of Dolhain.
We celebrate the return of one of our boys, the son of a cobbler,

<h3><i>The Rise of Belgian Industry</i></h3>

<p>Belgium’s story, as complex in pattern as the tapestry of Flemish
looms, is interwoven with the bright threads of genius, and, no less, with
the gold of commerce and the crimson
threads of war. Proud mistress of the arts
as Belgium can claim to be, she has held her
own for centuries past as a vigorous industrial
nation. Tribes that came across the
Rhine after Caesar’s conquest of the Gauls,
57-52 before Christ, were permitted by the
Romans to settle upon the lands that
extended from the basin of the Meuse River
to the sea. For ten centuries they diligently
tilled the soil, and as diligently fought
encroachment. About the year one thousand,
the Counts of Flanders, whose holdings
constituted one of nine Belgian principalities,
fortified the towns of Bruges, Ghent,
Courtrai and Ypres (broozh, gent<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>, koor-tray,
eep-r), and protected them with stout walls.
The granting of civic charters spurred these
Flemish communes to greater activity, and
cloth markets were established in each
walled town. It seems clear that before
any race of northern Europe the Flemish
turned from the plow to the counting-house,
from the farm to the crafts-shop.
Bruges was the most influential
financial city north of the Alps,
until its leadership was wrested by
Antwerp and then by Ghent in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Brussels,
the seat of ruling princes and an
important trading-station on the route
from Bruges to Cologne, boasted a
population of fifty thousand persons
as long ago as the year 1500. Liège
and Mons (monz), even then, were
noted for their metal industries.</p>

</div>

<p>But the very advantages that
contributed to the material advancement
of Belgium were responsible for
the invasions that times without
number reddened her soil and enslaved
her people. The territory occupied
by the Netherlanders (“the
people of the low lands,”&mdash;the Belgians
and the Dutch) lay in the track
of all the envious and ambitious
nations of Europe. One war succeeded
another until, in the year
1830, the Belgians freed themselves
of their final and most irritating
yoke by successfully employing arms
against Holland. At last the Belgians’ country was their own. And now
a new Belgium came into being. “Only one common trait,” says a
student of Belgian history, “connected the men of the two epochs&mdash;the
capacity for work.” The exploitation of the coal mines of Seraing (se-ran)
and Hainaut (hay-no), the discovery of iron mines, the establishment of
great foundries and manufactories, followed the consummation of national
independence. A system of railways was organized that had no superior in
Europe. The internal waterways of the country&mdash;the rivers, canalized
rivers and canals&mdash;aided in the transportation of manufactures, land products
and imports to the extent of millions of tons a year.</p>

<p>In the revived prosperity of Belgium, her kings played a vital role. Under
Leopold the First, a favorite uncle of Queen Victoria of England, a constitutional
monarchy was established that was a model of democracy. The taxes were light;
only a small standing army was maintained. The neutrality of the nation had been
guaranteed by the Treaty of London after the close of the war with Holland. “Freedom
reigns among us, without flaw and without infringement,” declared a patriot-orator,
forty years ago. Leopold the Second, who came to the throne in 1865, advanced
the agricultural, manufacturing and
maritime interests of the realm,
and, a short while before his death,
brought the Congo Free State,
over which he had held sovereignty
for twenty years, under the Belgian
flag. With the acquisition of
a colony eighty times as large as
the kingdom itself, Belgium became
the dazzled possessor of a treasure
land of mines, arable acres and
profitable forests. Rail and water
transportation were promoted by
Belgian and foreign companies,
eager to enjoy the rich opportunities
of the African colony, and
hundreds of trading-houses sprang
up to handle the Congo’s yield of
palm oils, copal, rubber, cocoa, copper, gold,
diamonds and ivory.</p>

<p>Upon the death of his uncle in 1909,
King Albert fell heir to the most densely
populated domain in the world. Over
seven million people inhabited a country
comprising about eleven thousand square
miles. If all the people of the New England
States were crowded within the
bounds of the State of Vermont, conditions
of life would be comparable with those of
the little kingdom of Belgium. Its rulers,
King Albert and his consort, Queen Elizabeth,
youngest daughter of the benevolent
Duke Charles of Bavaria, have always
kept very close to the hearts of their subjects,
and have never permitted the exacting
ceremonials of the court to usurp time
set aside for the consideration of the country’s intimate needs. The daily picture
of their “little Queen” driving to and fro among the charitable institutions of
Brussels is a sight familiar to the people. The Belgians are frank to say that,
should the monarchy ever become a republic, Albert and Elizabeth would be elected
the President and First Lady of the land. Each inhabitant contributes one
franc a year toward the support of the King, the Queen, Prince Leopold, Prince
Charles, and Princess Marie José.</p>

<h3><i>Belgian Thrift</i></h3>

<p>With the active support of the State, provident societies and savings banks exist
to foster habits of thrift. A co-operative society, “The People,” in Ghent, has a
membership of many thousands of families. It operates a bakery, a bank, a theater,
and numerous stores and mills. “The Peasants’ Union” owns assets valued at ten
million dollars. Trained advisers are employed by the Union to travel among the
farmers and suggest improved methods of raising crops and livestock. In point of
individual savings, Belgium held a place high on the list of nations before the War.</p>

<p>Belgium was a veritable hive of contented, thrifty workers before the German
hordes crossed her borders. And today, after more than four years of exhaustive warfare
and abysmal suffering, the nation is again rising to renew her forces, just as, so often
in the past, she has been constrained to rise and gird her industrial armor on after long
periods of oppression and abuse. In
1914 there were but five other countries
whose foreign trade was greater;
in her output of steel, glass, railway
rolling stock, beet sugar and textiles,
she could hold her own with bigger
rivals. Half her people were engaged
in manufacturing and allied pursuits,
and half in the cultivation of the soil.
Antwerp, “safest harbor on the Continent,”
ranked next to New York among
the ports of the world.</p>

<p class="caption">MONUMENTS ON THE BATTLEFIELD OF WATERLOO</p>

</div>

<p>When King Albert returned to his
capital after a tragic exile, this is what
he found: the Government railways,
interurban lines and canals almost
entirely out of commission; the
harbor of Antwerp closed; three
hundred thousand subjects homeless;
scores of factories totally
destroyed or too badly damaged
to operate; and sixteen hundred
coke furnaces, so vital to the manufacture
of steel, completely demolished.
The national debt had more
than quadrupled, and eight hundred
thousand laborers, through
enforced idleness, were receiving
their support from the Government.</p>

<h3><i>The Redemption of Belgium</i></h3>

<p>The unconquerable Belgians,
in whom burns the indomitable
flame of the Belgae of old, are already winning against these seemingly insuperable
odds. Homes have been built by the aid of the King Albert Fund, which has expended
up to the present time about ten million dollars for this purpose. The Government
has lent an immense sum to householders and manufacturers for the rebuilding of their
own dwellings and factories. Thousands of carloads of machinery have been recovered
from Germany through a well-organized “recuperation service,” authorized by
the Peace Treaty, and many mills, dismantled or destroyed by the enemy, are running
on part or full time. A large proportion of idle workmen have found occupation at
wages higher than they received before the War. Nearly all of the one hundred
steamship services leaving Antwerp for world ports have resumed sailings. The
thousand miles of railway lines destroyed by the invaders are now relaid, and traffic is
approaching normal. All this, some of it with
the financial aid of America, has been achieved
within a few months after the cessation of the
most destructive warfare in history. Belgium’s
withered acres and ravaged towns are rising like
the phoenix, reborn through fire.</p>

<h3><i>The Face of Belgium</i></h3>

<p>The face of Belgium shows us many moods.
Fisher villages and attractive seaside resorts
give color to the long ribbon of sand that
reaches for forty miles from the French to the
Dutch border. To the east is the low-lying
country from which Flanders&mdash;“the low land”&mdash;has
its name. Beyond this expanse resembling
the dike-protected regions of Holland is a
naturally sterile sandy plain that Flemish farmers
have by centuries of toil brought to a high
state of productivity. Still further toward the
sunrise are the grateful hills and waving
meadows of Brabant. To the south lies the
great coal and iron-bearing tract&mdash;the beautiless
but prodigally endowed region of the
<i>Borinage</i>, or Place of Boring. In the wild
forest land of the Ardennes, bounded by the
River Meuse and a part of France, Luxemburg, and Rhenish Prussia, are mountains
of no great elevation but singularly romantic beauty, and lofty tree-covered
plateaus, and rivers whose banks are adorned by charming cities and resorts. Historic
Dinant (dee-nan) and Namur, often described as among the loveliest towns in
Europe, lay in the Germans’ path on the march to the French border. The forts of
Namur fell on August 21, 1914, after thirty-six hours’ bombardment. On the following
day the allied armies suffered a momentous defeat at Charleroi (char-le-rwah),
and retreated by way of Mons into St. Quentin, France.</p>

<p>High among the forested ways of the Ardennes is Spa, the delightfully pretty and&mdash;in
normal times&mdash;very gay watering-place, which during the War was frequented by
visitors most unwelcome in Belgium. One of these visitors, whose military headquarters
were at Spa, has since been almost equally unwelcome as a resident of Holland.</p>

<h3><i>Obstinate Liège</i></h3>

<p>The Meuse, flowing through verdant Wallonia, embraces, with its tributary, the
Ourthe (oort), the spacious and advantageously situated city of Liège, whose inhabitants,
since its foundation, have been known for the sturdiness of their resistance
under attack, and for their “partiality for labor” when at liberty to pursue the walks
of peace. When Germany forced the armored door
defending the kingdom of the Belgians, and gained
entrance to the roads to France and the North Sea,
another chapter&mdash;this time a chapter that required four
long years for the writing&mdash;was added to the story of
war-scarred Liège.</p>

<p class="caption">A WALLOON FARMER AND HIS

</div>

<p>One of the traditions of the city is the excellence of
its weapon manufacture. A great proportion of the two
hundred thousand inhabitants gain their livelihood by
making arms and cannon. Nearby are the colossal ironworks
of Seraing, with upwards of 10,000 employees, who
turn out guns, bridges, boilers, armor-plate, ships.</p>

<h3><i>Brussels, the Capital</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Half-way across Belgium, midway
between Liège and Ostend, the capital of
the kingdom invites us to enter its gates.
Brussels had its beginning in a settlement
of the sixth century which occupied an
island in the marshy River Senne. The
river, ever a troublesome stream, is now
confined within viaducts, and the city has
climbed the heights above its hidden banks.
The dwellings of warrior tribes and the
castles of the mighty Dukes of Brabant
are supplanted by the substantial buildings
of a center of present-day life. For
the well-kept beauty of its streets and open
spaces, for its air of solid content and
well-contained vivacity, for its handsome
store-houses of ancient and modern art,
its massive but harmonious architecture,
its tempting shops and markets, and the
alluring grace of its medieval roofs and
towers, Brussels exacts universal admiration.
Fortunately, her fine streets and
buildings escaped the vandalism that
blighted or razed many other Belgian communities.
There is not space here to narrate
the tragedy of Brussels under enemy
domination. Encouraged by a staunch-hearted
King, the city is fast resuming its
former activities. Many of the great families
of the nation, resident in Brussels,
have been impoverished. Treasure places
have been sacked. There are indelible
lines of grief on the faces one sees in the
street. But the veil of mourning that so
long enveloped the city is withdrawn to
let in the sun of hope and renewed good
fortune. Beleaguered Brussels will soon
be herself again.</p>

<div class="verse indent2">Stands the belfry old and brown;</div>
<div class="verse">Thrice consumed and thrice rebuilded,</div>

<div class="verse right">&mdash;<i>Longfellow</i></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Of all places one goes to see, none has
a greater appeal to the imagination than
that rare old square in Brussels called the
<i>Grand’ Place</i>. It has been the scene of barbarous deeds of the Middle Ages; martyrs
and heroes have met their death here; and knights and damsels, dukes and ladies
have passed days in “skilful jousting” beneath its painted façades. Ranged about
its four sides are the halls dedicated to Middle-Century guilds&mdash;the Hall of the Sea
Captains, the Archers’ Hall; at the corner of Butter Street, the Hall of the Bakers;
the Hall of the Painters; the Hall of the Grease Merchants; the graceful House of
the King, and the Weigh House. More elegant than these, with their gilded lace-like
gables, slender pinnacles and suggestively romantic doorways, is the Gothic
<i>Hôtel de Ville</i>, or City Hall, with a tower 370 feet high, and a history that goes back
to the year 1400. A gracious picture,
indeed, is this redolent square when
Flemish peasant women drive in at
dawn and under the flame-tinted spires
unload their baskets of flowers and
garden vegetables and their shining
copper cans. When the market hour
has passed, they go by the Street of
the Mountain to worship in the twin-towered
Cathedral of Ste. Gudule and
St. Michael, which stands up impressively
above the lower town.</p>

<p>In the quarter dominated by the
cathedral is the Royal Palace, the
official residence of the Court; and the
majestic white Palace of Justice, “the
largest architectural work of the nineteenth
century,” which cost ten million dollars to build and contains nearly 300
court rooms and apartments. The Conservatory of Music, in a neighboring street,
has had many pupils and teachers whose names are familiar to all lovers of music&mdash;the
violin masters, Vieuxtemps, Wieniawski, César Thomson, Ysaye (a native of Liège),
and Alphonse Mailly, the organist.</p>

<p>Outside the limits of the city, beyond the canal that connects Brussels with the
sea, is the extensive Park of Laeken and the established residence of the King and
Queen. Another excursion out of Brussels takes us to the battlefield of Waterloo,
where the forces of the English and the Prussians defeated the French, June 18, 1815,
and made an end of the all-conquering career of the great Napoleon.</p>

<h3><i>Malines, Antwerp, Ghent</i></h3>

<p>On the road to Antwerp we digress a little to visit the very old Flemish town of
Louvain (loo-van), whose name was early written into the history of the War through
the ruthless destruction of the library of the University&mdash;two centuries ago the most
distinguished seat of learning in Europe. The Town
Hall, moreover, has always been given first place
among all the ornately beautiful halls of the nation.</p>

<p>Malines (mah-leen), called Mechlin in Flemish,
betrays wounds inflicted during three weeks’ bombardment.
It has wide fame for its lace and its
cathedral pictures, and for its amazing clock tower.
When it was begun in the year 1452, the architect
of the tower intended to make it “the highest in
Christendom”; but he never reached what we may
call the height of his ambition. The square, unfinished
structure rises magnificently 318 feet above
the street, but does not approach by 200 feet the
lofty tower of the Cathedral of Ulm, in the kingdom
of Württemberg.</p>

<p>The site of Antwerp, fifty miles inland from the
North Sea, on a wide curve of the Scheldt (skelt),
has been coveted and assailed, built and rebuilt
upon since the dawn of European civilization. No
city has a more affluent history, nor one that contains
gloomier chronicles of siege and warfare. Its
wharves and its narrow streets, bulked by the over-watching
citadel and the flamboyant tower of one
of the finest churches in
Belgium, are teeming with
wharfmongers and brokers,
dealers in diamonds and
ivory, lace-makers, flower
vendors, factory-workers.
One sees many artists, too,
for the Academy of Antwerp
is attended by hundreds of
students, attracted to the
“city on the wharf” by the
unequaled opportunities presented
for the study of Flemish
masters, ancient and
modern, whose works are
exhibited in the Cathedral of
Notre Dame and in the vast galleries
of the Royal Museum of
Fine Arts.</p>

Erasmus, Justus Lipsius, and other renowned scholars</p>

</div>

<p>In the sixteenth-century
rooms of the master printers,
Christopher Plantin and his son-in-law,
John Moretus, we examine
the yellowed manuscripts of aspiring
authors of that day; presses
and proof-sheets; wood-cut designs
by Rubens, and the original shop

turned out excellent books by grant

Bible.</p>

<p>Of Ghent, “the City of Flowers,”
Maurice Maeterlinck its
poet-son has written, “It is the
soul of Flanders, at once venerable and young. In its streets the past and present
elbow each other.” The citizenry of Ghent, from remote times, have been reputed
for their independence and impetuous resource to arms. Many of the branching
canals which connected it with Bruges, Courtrai, Tournai, Antwerp and Brussels
have now silted up, but a comparatively modern ship canal leading to the Scheldt and
the sea gives the bustling old city communication with the ports of the world.
Freed of the Germans, Ghent is once more treading the looms of industry. Once
more tourists will come to look upon one of the chief glories of Flanders, a turreted
stronghold of ninth-century foundation, with towers and buttresses, winding stairs,
dungeons, donjon and banqueting hall associated with the exploits of crusading knights
and the patrician counts of Flanders. The most precious example of primitive
Flemish painting, “The Adoration of the Lamb,” by the brothers Van Eyck, had
for centuries hung in the noble Cathedral of St. Bavon, before it was sent by the
Germans to adorn the Berlin Museum. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles,
this masterpiece, with all others stolen by the enemy, becomes once more the property
of the Belgians. Most attractive are the communities of white-coiffed, blue-garbed
nuns who live in spotless little houses, and devote their lives to the making of fine
lace and embroidery. And greatly revered by native Ghenters is the soaring belfry
tower from which Freedom’s alarms have so often rung out across the Flemish Plain.</p>

<h3><i>In West Flanders</i></h3>

<p>With the names of many
places in the province of West
Flanders, the despatches of war
have acquainted us. Battered
Audenarde; proud Ypres, held
first by the Germans and then so
long and so stubbornly by Haig’s
men; Dixmude; the Yser Canal
that flowed crimson to the sea;
Nieuport, Westende, Middelkerke,
leveled like wheat before the
mower; Ostend, whose leisurely
crowds were scattered before the
gray tidal wave that swept across
these lowlands, leaving a swath 70,000 acres broad of ruined farms and villages. It is
proposed not to attempt the resurrection of the city of Ypres, but to leave as they
are the shell-torn walls, the cluttered streets, and the wreck of the superb Cloth
Hall, with its massive reach of wall and roof and belfry, as a place of pilgrimage
in years to come. In the thirteenth century Ypres flourished as a cloth-weaving
center, with a population of over 200,000. At the beginning of the World War it had
about 18,000 inhabitants, most of whom were engaged in the making and marketing
of Valenciennes lace.</p>

<p>No one that roams today the quaintly narrowed streets of Bruges, or stands upon
its many bridges gazing upon the green of quiet waters, where swans drift and storied
towers cast their shadows, would guess that traders from far Novgorod and the cities
of Persia, from Spain and all the countries
of Europe once animated its highways.
Every ruler, every industry,
every craft and art that contributed
to the dowering of Bruges left upon it
some well-graved mark, which Time
has not erased. In the old quarters&mdash;and
there are few new ones&mdash;there is
scarcely a street that does not offer
some reward to the sight-seeker&mdash;some
fretted casement or sculptured entrance-way,
some gracefully designed structure
that has a special story of its own,
and gives shelter to works of art
beyond price. Rising benevolently
above the great square is the quadrangular
belfry tower, as lofty as it
is historic, that Longfellow has made
familiar to us all.</p>

<p class="caption">Compare this picture with Gravure No. 1. Both were photographed from about the same spot. As may be seen,
the devastation wrought by the War is almost complete. The main façade of the great Cloth Hall had a frontage
of 433 feet; the square bell tower was 230 feet high</p>

</div>

<p>From the earliest times the Belgae have
been known as a hardy, courageous and
determined people. Julius Caesar had as
much trouble in his day in subduing them
as the Kaiser had with their descendants
in the first year of the World War. Caesar
came into conflict with the Belgae when
he was campaigning for the conquest of
Gaul in 57 B. C., and it was only after
long fighting that he crushed them. Even
then they refused to remain in subjection.
In a few years several of the Belgae tribes
revolted, and had to be dealt with anew.
When the Roman Empire was reorganized
under Augustus, the Belgae were included
in the province of Gallia Belgica, which
extended from the west bank of the Rhine
to the North Sea and south to Lake Constance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>Julius Caesar wrote, in his history of the
Conquest of Gaul, “<i>Horum omnium fortissimi
sunt Belgae</i>,” which, freely translated,
means that “the Belgae were, all
around, the bravest” of the races that the
Roman Conqueror met in the Gallic wars.
Caesar was a man of cool, clear judgment,
not averse to giving a doughty foe due
credit, and several trying experiences in
fierce encounters with the Belgae had
afforded him a just measure of their fearless,
intrepid qualities. His appraisal of
their valor has had full confirmation in
our day&mdash;with all the peoples of the earth,
but the Huns, sympathetic witnesses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/stars.jpg" width="100" height="19" alt="(decorative)" />
</div>

<p>The attitude of the nations toward
“Belgium the Brave” has probably found
no more glowing expression than in the
eloquent tribute of Mr. Hugh Stokes, in
his recent book on the Belgians. “To an
indomitable race,” he exclaims, “civilized
mankind offers a silent homage. A new
meaning has been given to the inspiration
of patriotism. And, in showing us how
death can be despised Belgium rises to a
new life and an immortal
glory among
the nations.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">We have traveled from Flanders and its great cities
into Brabant, gazing for a moment at Liège and the
towns on the Meuse, briefly touching the Ardennes,
Hainaut and the country around Tournai. The
records of these ancient provinces are rich in tradition
and incident. From the tapestries off the looms of
Audenarde and Brussels peer all the fabulous heroes of
antiquity.… So in printed word, with dropped stitches and
many a gap in the story, may be discovered through the misty
veil of time the roofs of Bruges; Jan van Artevelde inflaming
the crowds beneath the Belfry of Ghent; all the Counts of
Flanders and Dukes of Burgundy; Godfrey of Bouillon riding
at the head of the Crusaders; Spanish captains and Austrian
archdukes, Don John, Alva and Farnese; the frail steeple of
Antwerp rising above a “kermesse” in the Place de Meir; the
“Ommegang” passing in front of the King’s House of Brussels;
Justus Lipsius philosophizing before the Hôtel de Ville of
Louvain; Wolsey enthroned beneath the five towers of Tournai,
and Becket slaking his thirst at the village well of Loo.…
These are the shadows on the frayed and worn hangings.
Cities and men. Cities from which the magnificence has in
many cases departed, men whose glory is in every case but a
handful of ashes.</p>

<p>To the good citizen, as well as to the statesman, the story
of Belgium presents innumerable problems, and teaches the
sternest of lessons. Many of the difficulties remain to be
solved. Centuries will not exhaust the retribution which
must be exacted for the martyrdom of this heroic kingdom.
A country may be devastated, but its history cannot be wiped
from the chronicles.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
